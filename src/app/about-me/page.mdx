# about me

<strong>tl;dr</strong> probably you'd rather check [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-mart%C3%ADn-ziger-729b48204).

I, the writer of this page, am also the author of this site. My name is, and so is my surname. In short, my name and surname are.

I was born, curiously, on the same day as my birthday. That said, I can't disclose the exact date of my birthday. What I can say without fear is that precisely on the day I was born, I started living. Moreover, at the time of writing this, I am certain that I'm still alive.

One of the most notable things about my personality is an apparent interest in mathematical problems, which can be evidenced by the fact that, for example, I am capable of counting up to one hundred without too many mistakes. It's for this reason that, emulating the ancient Diophantus, I intend to reveal my age through a mathematical riddle:

Let $A$ be the current year. For simplicity, we will consider my age as of December 31st of the current year. Then, my age $E$ is given by the equation:

<div className='center'>$E + n = A$</div>

where $n$ is the year of my birth.

Another evident trait of my personality is my interest in programming, and this is clear to the extent that I have already developed my own personal website (which, for those who are not aware, can be visited by clicking [here](#)).

With this line, and after having gone into detail about myself, I conclude this autobiography.
