## Component for "books"

The same way you can create a zettel grid, have a component which allows viewing one zettel after another, just as in a "book", where each zettel is a small paragraph. Also, chapter, index, etc.

## Definitions / theorems in different zettels

Each definition / theorem should be part of a different zettel. Having a very sparse text-base could be very difficult to manage. Ponder if there's any nice workaround for this.

## Toolkits & refs

For footnotes, it would be nice to have a toolkit popping up. If each toolkit is also a zettel, this wouldn't be a problem. Moreover, it should allow you to both show it at the bottom of the page and as a toolkit.

Also, we could have a component which is a link/ref to a zettel (1. to show in a different page, 2. to show in the same page) or even show a peep of the zettel as a toolkit (maybe instead of abstract, peep is a better name). This is nice recently defined objects could be peeped when hovering over. Maybe a little logic would be necessary to parse normal text into this format.

## Revision history

Implement a way to review different versions of each zettel

(this will be postponed to a better time)
