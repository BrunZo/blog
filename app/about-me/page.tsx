      <h1 className='font-bold text-3xl mt-2'>about me</h1>
        <p className='mt-3'> <strong>tl;dr</strong> probably you'd rather check <a className='text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-800' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-mart%C3%ADn-ziger-729b48204">my LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        <p> I, the writer of this page, am also the author of this site. My name is, and so is my surname. In short, my name and surname are.</p>
        <p>I was born, curiously, on the same day as my birthday. That said, I can't disclose the exact date of my birthday. What I can say without fear is that precisely on the day I was born, I started living. Moreover, at the time of writing this, I am certain that I’m still alive.</p>
        <p>One of the most notable things about my personality is an apparent interest in mathematical problems, which can be evidenced by the fact that, for example, I am capable of counting up to one hundred without too many mistakes. It’s for this reason that, emulating the ancient Diophantus, I intend to reveal my age through a mathematical riddle:</p>
        <p>Let <strong>A</strong> be the current year. For simplicity, we will consider my age as of December 31st of the current year. Then, my age <strong>E</strong> is given by the equation:</p>
        <p className='center'><strong>E + n = A</strong></p>
        <p>where <strong>n</strong> is the year of my birth.</p>
        <p>Another evident trait of my personality is my interest in programming, and this is clear to the extent that I have already developed my own personal website (which, for those who are not aware, can be visited by clicking <a href="#">here</a>).</p>
        <p>With this line, and after having gone into detail about myself, I conclude this autobiography.</p>
